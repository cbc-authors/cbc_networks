# E.4 CIFAR-10
To evaluate the CBCs scaling to RGB images with a lot of background noise we 
trained a CBC on the CIFAR-10 dataset and compared it to a baseline CNN. 

A pretrained weights file for both the CBC and the CNN are available. 

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is available by default in Keras.
